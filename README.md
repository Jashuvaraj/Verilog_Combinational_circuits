# Verilog Combinational Logic Circuits

A structured collection of combinational logic designs implemented in Verilog HDL. This repository includes RTL design, gate-level and behavioral implementations, along with corresponding testbenches for simulation and verification.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **adders/**  
  Half adder, full adder, ripple carry adder (4-bit), with DUT & TB

- **multiplexers/**  
  2:1, 4:1, 8:1 MUX (gate-level and conditional operator)

- **encoders/**  
  4:2 encoder, priority mappings

- **decoders/**  
  2:4 decoder, one-hot line decoding

- **demultiplexers/**  
  1:4 demux with select-based fan-out

- **logic_gates/**  
  Basic gates using logic AND gates  
  AND/OR/NAND/NOR/XOR/XNOR/NOT  
  and also implemented using **only 2:1 MUX**

- **comparator/**  
  2-bit comparator with greater/less/equal flags

## 🛠 Simulation Tools Used

These designs are verified using:

- QuestaSim  
- ModelSim  
- Vivado Simulator  
- EDA Playground  

Each module is testbench-verified with monitor-based output tracing.


Each design prints signal activity, enabling waveform + text-based verification.
